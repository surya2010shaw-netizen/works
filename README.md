# Cloth Shop Billing

## Employee and admin dashboards

The app opens in **Employee** mode: existing catalog items, fixed prices with
automatic admin-defined offers, quantities, customer details, full payment and receipts. GST is automatically included in the
amount due using the existing calculation: a ₹100 price with 5% GST totals ₹105.

**Admin login** unlocks exchanges, offers, manual discounts, partial payments, credit, inventory, customers,
balances, expenses, sales history, statistics, backup and update buttons. The recommended copy also has whole-database
CSV export. **Lock** clears the unfinished bill
and returns to employee access. Restarting always begins in Employee mode.

In both Employee and Admin billing, typing a phone number shows matching
`phone — customer name` suggestions. Selecting one fills the existing customer
details and uses their stored phone number for the bill.

The admin password configured for this release also authorizes deletion confirmations.
The local application access gate does not replace Windows account/file permissions
for protecting the SQLite database or preventing edits to the program itself.

The receipt's UPI QR uses the recorded payment amount. For example, a ₹700 bill
with **Paid now** set to ₹200 generates a ₹200 QR and shows ₹500 outstanding.
The QR caption shows the same payment amount. A fully credit bill (₹0 paid) has
no payment QR. Reopening a receipt uses its current total recorded payments.

## Screen sizes, printing, backup and updates

Billing uses two columns on wide screens. On smaller windows, switch between
**Customer / Add items** and **Bill**; adding an item brings the bill forward.
The Bill view has its own barcode field for repeated scanning.
The cart uses the remaining height, payment fields scroll when needed, and
**Complete Bill** stays visible. Management pages can scroll in smaller windows.
Admin controls share the tab row instead of taking a separate row.

Receipts open within the screen's usable area. **Print A4**, **Save PDF** and
**Close** stay outside the scrolling preview. Print opens a printer chooser with
copies; install the printer's Windows driver if no printer is listed. Failed
jobs show an error. If a submitted job does not reach paper, check the Windows
print queue, connection and printer status.

In Admin mode, **Backup** lets you choose a folder for a complete SQLite `.db`
backup. It includes customers, bills, payments, inventory and all other tables,
using SQLite's online backup operation while the app is open. Both app copies
provide this button; copies have unique names and do not overwrite each other.

**Update** checks the checkout's current remote tracking branch. Choose
**Back up, update and rebuild** to close billing, fast-forward that same branch,
build a new executable in a staging folder and reopen it. Git for Windows,
standard supported Python and an internet connection are required. Local edits,
local-only commits and divergent history stop the update. The previous executable
is retained if building fails, and a successful update keeps
`ClothShopBilling.previous.exe` alongside the new executable. A failed build may
leave the source checkout updated; retry Update to rebuild, or use the previous
executable. Build details are in the app folder's `setup.log`.

Run the executable from `app/dist` or `Billing_App/app/dist` inside its complete
Git clone so Update can locate it. A detached executable or ZIP copy needs a Git
clone first. **Existing installations need one initial pull and rebuild to get
these buttons.** After that, use Update; manually deleting the executable is not
required. Complete or clear unfinished bills before updating. The updater takes
a database backup before closing and keeps the database in the same user profile.

## Windows: install and build

1. Install **standard 64-bit Python 3.13** from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/), including the Python launcher. Supported: Windows 10/11 x64, CPython 3.10–3.14. Free-threaded Python, 32-bit Python and ARM64 Python are not supported by this build path.
2. Clone the repository, or download and **extract the complete ZIP** into a folder you can write to. Keep the `tools` folder with the application folders.
3. Double-click **`setup.bat` at the repository root**. Internet is needed to install packages.
4. When it reports success, open **`Billing_App\app\dist\ClothShopBilling.exe`**.

The root setup builds the copy with backup/export tools. `Billing_App\setup.bat`
uses the same setup. To build the alternate root `app` copy, run
`app\build_windows.bat`; its executable is in `app\dist`.

Setup chooses a compatible interpreter, installs packages into that app's
`.venv-windows` folder, checks database/desktop/receipt behavior using temporary
data, and builds the executable. It does not install into your global Python or
require Administrator access. Keep using the same shop Windows account: its data
lives at `%USERPROFILE%\.cloth_shop_billing\cloth_shop.db`.

For a manual update, pull changes, close the running billing executable and run setup again.
The app environment is reused when healthy and repaired when the selected Python
changes. Old generated build files and Python caches do not belong in Git.

## If setup fails

The window stays open with a short error. The detailed log is:

- Recommended copy: `Billing_App\app\setup.log`
- Alternate copy: `app\setup.log`

Share that file and the first error, rather than copying thousands of console
lines. Setup stops on the failing step and never reports a failed build as a
success. It requests binary wheels only, so unsupported packages fail clearly
instead of attempting a C/C++ or Rust build.

For a Python detection error, install a supported standard x64 Python and reopen
setup. For package download errors, check your internet/proxy settings. For file
access errors, close the app and place the repository in a writable folder.

Do not delete your `.cloth_shop_billing` data folder to repair setup. An existing
unrecognized `.venv-windows` folder is left alone; rename it if setup asks you to.

## Advanced checks

From Command Prompt at the repository root:

```bat
setup.bat --skip-build
```

This installs dependencies and runs the source smoke checks without creating an
executable. For automation, set `BILLING_NO_PAUSE=1` before invoking a batch file;
every entry point preserves the setup process's exit code.

See [tests/README.md](tests/README.md) for regression commands and historical data
limitations. A native Windows build and packaged-app startup check is still
required before distributing an executable; Linux and wheel-resolution checks
alone do not establish that the packaged Windows application runs.

## Reports and date filters

Sales History, Balances, Expenses and Statistics share these period choices:
Today, Last 7 days, Last 30 days, This month, Selected month, Month range,
Custom dates and All time. Month ranges include both entire months; custom
ranges include both boundary days, including bills with timestamps. All time
includes every recorded date. Select a month to see that month's bills immediately.
Changing a filter refreshes the report; **Apply / Refresh** reloads current data.
Invalid ranges clear the result and prevent an export of stale rows.

CSV exports use the current period and any search/category filter, even if you
haven't pressed Refresh. Balances offers an export of all matched bills and a
separate export of the selected customer's payments. Statistics exports its
summary metrics and the selected period's daily, monthly, product, brand/style and category
series. CSV is UTF-8 for Excel, with spreadsheet formulas escaped in text fields.

Statistics includes total revenue, expenses, net profit, payments collected,
outstanding credit, bill count, pieces sold, average bill value, and daily mean,
median and population standard deviation. Daily statistics use days with sales,
including days with zero-value bills. Monthly and daily bars use the selected
period. The doughnut chart switches between products, brands/styles and categories; small groups
beyond the top eight are combined as Other.

Best Selling Items shows category, Brand / Style and item name together (for
example, Shirts → CK → CK shirt). Best Selling Brands / Styles groups each brand
within its category. Both tables show the top ten by quantity sold or revenue,
using the selected period; CSV includes all groups. Exchange returns reduce
quantity and revenue. Reports use current catalog labels; items without a brand
show “No brand / style”, and historical lines without a linked catalog item show
“Unknown brand / style”. Missing historical brands cannot be reconstructed.

Definitions:

- Revenue uses bill dates and includes GST. Net profit here means billed revenue
  minus recorded expenses; the app does not track item purchase cost separately.
- Payments collected uses payment dates, including collections on older bills.
- Outstanding means the current unpaid amount on bills issued in the period.
  Balances' "Paid toward these bills" includes later payments too. Its separate
  payment history uses the payment-date filter.
- Product/brand/category revenue allocates each bill's total to its lines, including
  historical bill-level discounts and GST. Allocations retain exact cents so
  chart totals reconcile to billed revenue.

Click a bill row in Balances or Customers' Purchase History to view, print or save
its receipt. Clicking a payment row in Balances opens that payment's bill receipt.
The Balances panes can be resized by dragging their dividers. Receive-payment and
delete buttons keep their own actions. All reporting tools remain admin-only.

### Reporting performance and reliability

Tables display up to 200 rows per page. Use **Previous / Next** to browse the
remaining matches. Totals and CSV exports always include the entire filtered
result, including rows on other pages. Exports are written to a temporary file
and replace the chosen file only after successful completion.

Reports load when their tab is opened and refresh on each visit. Saving a bill
no longer calculates hidden reports. Changing a chart's product/category or
ranking option reuses the current report; **Apply / Refresh** reads fresh data.
The trend uses monthly bars above 180 active sales days, with explicitly monthly
mean/deviation labels. Daily cards and exported daily rows retain daily values.

Date filters use SQLite date indexes. Report totals use integer cents and exact
Decimal aggregation for collections/expenses; historical bill discounts are
allocated to products with cent reconciliation. Query snapshots keep report
cards and chart series consistent during writes. SQLite WAL uses FULL write
synchronization in both desktop copies. No optional database fields are removed.

## Automatic category and brand offers

Log in as admin and open **Offers → New offer**. Enter a name, the number of
pieces per bundle, and the **total bundle price before GST**. Add the eligible
category / brand combinations, then save with **Active** checked. You can mix
several combinations in one deal, or create separate offers for separate groups.
Use **All brands / styles** for a category-wide offer. Brands are the existing
Inventory **Brand / Style** values; matching uses their IDs, not item-name text.

For example, with catalog prices of ₹800 each, add Free Soul in Jackets and Free
Soul in Sweatshirts to a bundle of **3 pieces for ₹2,000**. Any mix of those
combinations qualifies. At 5% GST, three cost ₹2,100; four cost ₹2,940; six cost
₹4,200. No example rule is automatically inserted into your database.

Employees get active offers automatically when adding, removing or changing
quantities. They still cannot edit prices, enter manual discounts, or accept
partial/credit payments. Admins manage offers and retain their manual discounts.
The bill displays offer savings, and receipts store the offer name and savings
as historical snapshots. Changing an offer never reprices an old receipt.

Select a row in Offers to edit it. Uncheck **Active** and save to disable it;
use the **Disabled** filter to find it later. The list has 200-row pages and an
indexed name-prefix search. The details panel scrolls on smaller screens.

Pricing rules:

- Every complete qualifying bundle can repeat; leftover pieces retain regular
  prices. Only bundles that reduce the price apply. With unequal catalog prices,
  the highest-priced eligible pieces enter bundles first.
- One active offer is allowed per exact category / brand combination. Conflicts
  are rejected without overwriting an existing offer. Brand-specific offers take
  priority over an all-brands offer; offers do not stack on the same pieces.
- Custom prices entered by admins do not receive automatic bundles. Manual admin
  discounts on catalog-priced lines apply after the bundle saving and cannot
  make the line negative.
- Discounts are allocated in exact cents. Bundle GST is rounded once per offer
  and tax rate, then allocated to its lines, so splitting a bundle among products
  does not lose a tax cent. Different GST rates remain separate.
- The app rechecks offers and employee pricing inside the bill transaction. If
  an offer changes while a draft is open, use **Refresh offers**, confirm the new
  total and complete the bill again.

Billing fetches only the category / brand rules relevant to cart items through a
unique active-scope index. It does not load the entire offer list. Large quantities
are calculated per cart line rather than expanding into individual pieces.

## Admin exchanges

Open **Admin → Exchanges** and search by the customer's **full phone number** or
an **exact bill number** (letter case does not matter). Select the original bill,
check its receipt if needed, and choose the number of pieces being returned.
Then click **Continue to new purchases**, scan/add the replacement items and any
extra purchases, choose the payment method, and complete the bill.

- New purchases, including GST and current offers/discounts, must cost **strictly
  more** than the returned items. Collect the entire positive difference. Equal
  or lower totals are blocked; there are no refunds or store credits.
- Return value uses the original paid price, including its discounts/offers and
  GST. Later catalog price changes do not change that value. Partial quantities
  divide the original line value, with cumulative cent allocation so returning
  every piece never loses or creates money. A ₹2,100 three-piece line credits
  ₹700 for one piece. The remaining pieces keep their original prices.
- Settle any outstanding payment on the original bill in **Balances** first.
  Walk-in bills can be found by bill number without adding a customer phone.
- The original bill stays intact. A linked exchange receipt shows returned lines
  as negatives, new purchases as positives, and the difference paid. It can be
  reprinted from Sales History, Customers, or Balances. Bills linked to an
  exchange cannot be deleted because that would break stock/payment history.
- Returned quantities are restored to stock; new purchases deduct stock. Saving
  the exchange, returned quantities, stock and payment is one transaction. The
  same original piece cannot be returned twice. Retrying the same save does not
  create another bill. New purchased pieces can later be exchanged using their
  full purchase value on the linked receipt.
- Reports record the net sale and pieces on the exchange date, and only the new
  money collected. Original sale dates remain unchanged. Product/category charts
  use signed bars when the selected period contains a negative net group, so
  returned value is included correctly. Bill counts include exchange receipts.
- Lookup uses indexed phone/bill matching and 100 bills per page. Employees cannot
  access the exchange screens or commands. Existing optional database fields
  remain optional; exchange history uses additional tables.

## Employee attendance and expenses

Open **Admin → Employees**. Add an employee with their name and optional phone,
or search by the beginning of their name. Employee IDs and phone numbers help
separate people with the same name. Choose a month, then select the employee.

- The **Attendance sheet** lists every day in that month. Select a day, choose
  **Full Day**, **Half Day**, or **Absent**, and click **Save attendance**.
  **Not marked** clears a mistaken entry. Admins can correct earlier dates;
  future attendance cannot be marked. Saving a day again updates its existing
  entry. Employee mode cannot view or change these records.
- **Days attended** counts dates marked Full Day or Half Day, with separate full
  and half-day counts. Unmarked dates are not assumed absent; future dates are
  shown as Upcoming. No salary is calculated automatically from these counts.
- **Employee expenses** records money paid for Salary, Salary advance, Travel,
  Food, or another category. The selected month shows that employee's total and
  history. These are the same expense records used by Expenses and Statistics,
  so they enter shop totals once. If an advance was already recorded, enter
  only the remaining amount when paying salary; do not record the full salary
  again. This is a record of payments, not an automatic payroll/loan system.
- Export the selected month's attendance or all its employee expense rows to CSV.
  History is paged at 100 rows, while totals and exports include all matches.
- Use **Edit / Archive** and clear Active to archive someone. Their history stays
  available through **Include archived**; restore them before adding/correcting
  records. Existing employee IDs, roles, optional fields, and attendance remain
  intact. Older expenses without an employee link remain shop expenses; the app
  does not guess which employee they belong to.
